##Codebook
==========================

The purpose of this Codebook is to identify the results from running the R script "run_analysis.R" located in the same repository.

The script gets and cleans the data from the following source by creating one dataset that includes the participant, activity and all captured metrics. A tidy dataset is written to "Average.txt" which reports on the average mean and standard deviation for each participant and activity.

The codebook follows--
Subject- Participant recorded
Activity- Activity preformed when metrics recorded. The activities include
* Walking
* Walking upstairs
* Walking downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying
